Dataset Source:
For demo1.ipynb Download "1,058.4kW, poly-Si, Fixed, 2016, Desert Gardens" from https://dkasolarcentre.com.au/download?location=yulara
For demo2.ipynb Using './data_original/solar_stations/Solar station site 4 (Nominal capacity-130MW).xlsx' from https://github.com/Bob05757/Renewable-energy-generation-input-feature-variables-analysis which is the dataset provided by [Solar and wind power data from the Chinese State Grid Renewable Energy Generation Forecasting Competition](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01696-6#citeas)
demo1 and demo2 are using past 5 steps (lookback window 5) to forecast 1 step in the future (in demo1, forecast half an hour later; in demo2, forecast an hour later)
